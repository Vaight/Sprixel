## A pixel art program
Hello!
This is a small open-source pixel art program I am working on as an exercise to get more familiar with the godot game engine. If I dont release it assume I died.

If this gains enough traction I can continue the project, but my hopes aren't too high on the performance of such a program in a game engine instead of just writing it with a major language like C++.

My trello is public so you can see what's going on.

## Update v4.0-test (12/2/2022)
Hello again!
This update fixes many optimization issues relating to the draw() function lagging at high canvas sizes.
```
Colors are now supported
